## §1 Asynchronous Decisions Only

The Secretariat Working Committee does not hold meetings, and makes decisions asynchronously only.

## §2 Assignment of Draft Numbers and Draft Targetting

Upon the appropriate petition by any person, the Secretariat Working Committee shall assign a draft number and targets for proposed Specifications, provided that:
* The Proposal Text does not violate the Code of Conduct of the LCS Project or the Secretariat Working Committee,
* The Target Working Committee or Working Committees for the Proposed Specification can be reasonably identified.

Draft Assignments shall not be rejected on the merits of the proposed Specification.
Any Member of the Working Committeee may make a Draft Assignment.

All Draft Assignments shall be recorded, along with a Tentative Title, and the specified Target Working Committees.

## §3 Assignment of Publication Numbers

### §3.1 Publication Number Assignment (§4 Review Process)

Any Draft Specification that has suitably completed Steps 1 through 5 of the Review Process set forth in [§4 of LCS1](https://github.com/lcs-project/publications/blob/main/primary/LCS1.md#4-steps-of-publication) may be assigned a Publication Number by the Secretariat Working Committee.

The Secretariat Working Committee shall ensure the Working Committees which reviewed the Draft agree that the Draft is suitably prepared for publication before assigning a Publication Number.

Issuance of a Publication Number Assignment may be denied if:
* The Draft Specification has not suitably completed the review process, as identified by each Working Committee invovled in review, or
* The Application for a Publication Number violates the Code of Conduct of the LCS Project or the Secretariat Working Committee.

Any Member of the Working Committee may make a Publication Number Assignment under this Section provided no member objects within 24 hours.

### §3.2 Publication Number Assignment (Notwithstanding §4)

Any Draft Specification that has not completed Steps 1 through 5 of the §4 Review Process, may be assigned a Publication Number.  
To Recieve a Publication Number Assignment, a member of the LCS Leads must sponsor the Application. 
This Member must represent that the LCS Leads intend to publish the Specification notwithstanding [§4 of LCS1](https://github.com/lcs-project/publications/blob/main/primary/LCS1.md#4-steps-of-publication), and are likely to do so.

The Sponsoring member may indicate conditions the Draft must satisfy to recieve the assignment. 

Issuance of a Publication Number Assignment may be denied if:
* A Sponsor of the Application cannot be identified among the LCS Leads, 
* The Sponsor indicates that the LCS Leads do not intend to publish the Specification notwithstanding §4 or are unlikely to do so,
* The Sponsor indicates a list of conditions the Draft must satisfy, and the Draft fails to satisfy those conditions, or
* The Application for a Publication Number violates the Code of Conduct of the LCS Project or the Secretariat Working Committee.

All Members of the Secretariat Working Committee must agree to issue a Publication Number Assignment under this section.

### §3.3 Term of Assignment

Regardless of whether a Publication Number was assigned under §3.1 or §3.2, the assignment lasts for a term of a minimum of 6 months, at which point the application expires and the Publication Number may be reassigned by the Working Committee. Once an assignment expires, it can no longer be used by a Draft Publication.

An assignment may be extended, either at the date of issuance, or any time prior to its expiry, if, in the opinion of the Working Committee, the Draft Publication cannot be reasonably be presented to the LCS Leads for publication within the remaining term. In the case of an extension after issuance, the Working Committee must be satisfied that sufficient progress has been made. 

Any Member of the Working Committee satisified that the requirements are met may issue an extension, provided no member objects within 24 hours. Issuance of an Extension is discretionary and no right to extension is provided. 

Extensions are made for 6 months or a multiple thereof. The term of an Extension begins on the date the assignment would have otherwise expired, regardless of the date the extension is issued.

### §3.4 Recording of Assignments

All Publication Number Assignments and Extensions shall be recorded along with the following information:
* The date of issuance,
* The Draft Number assigned to the Draft Specification,
* All Working Committees involved in reviewing the Draft Specification,
* The known title of the Draft Specification, excluding the style,
* The canonical location of the Draft Specification, if known and public,
* The date on which the assignment expires, and
* Under which section of these rules the assignment or extension was made.


## §4 Limited Code of Conduct

All Applications for Draft and Publication Numbers shall obey the following rules, in addition to the Code of Conduct of the LCS Project:
1. No person shall unreasonably, intentionally or in a substantially negligent manner, make repeated or nonsencial Applications for Draft or Publication Numbers or Publication Number Assignment Extensions,
2. No person shall make an Application for a Draft or Publication Number Assignment, or Publication Number Assignment Extension, knowing that the application is faulty, improper, or otherwise has no reasonable likelihood of success.

Any application made in violation of these rules may be denied for that reason, with or without communication on the matter. Additionally, any person who violates these rules may be permanently refused Draft and Publication Number Assignments.

## §5 Special Publications and Membership Rules

The Working Committee may make Special Publications in regards to Working Committee Rules, Membership Rules, and a Code of Conduct. 
Any such special publications shall be approved by all members of the Working Committee.

Approval of any person to be added as a Member shall be by approval of all current members. Removal of any member shall be by approval of all other members.
