# Secretariat Working Committee

LCS Project, Secretariat Working Committee Repository.

The Secretariat Working Committee is responsible for assigning draft and publication numbers to Specifications, as well as assigning target Working Committees for Drafts.


The Secretariat Working Committee is created by [§6 of LCS 1](https://github.com/lcs-project/publications/blob/main/primary/LCS1.md#6-secretariat-working-committee-and-publication-number-assignment). It is a procedural Working Committee and cannot review draft publications. It may make Special Publications identified by [§2](https://github.com/lcs-project/publications/blob/main/primary/LCS1.md#2-working-committees) and [§8.3 of LCS1](https://github.com/lcs-project/publications/blob/main/primary/LCS1.md#82-membership-of-working-committees).

## Draft Number Assignments

Any person preparing a Specification for review by the LCS Project may request a Draft Number Assignment by submitting a [Draft Number Application](https://github.com/lcs-project/secretariat/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=01-draft-number-assignment.yml).
In this process, the Working Committee will also assign the Target Working Committee for the Draft. 

The authority and requirements of issuing Draft Numbers are indicated by Item 1 of [§4 of LCS 1](https://github.com/lcs-project/publications/blob/main/primary/LCS1.md#4-steps-of-publication). 

Draft Numbers are assigned permanently, and assignments cannot be revoked or reused, even if the Draft is later abandoned. 

The Draft Number Assignments are placed in <draft-assignments.csv>.

## Publication Number Assignments

Any person who has prepared a Draft Specification, and subject it appropriately to review, may apply to have that Draft Specification assigned a publication Number, by submitting a [Publication Number Application](https://github.com/lcs-project/secretariat/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=02-publication-number-assignment-regular.yml).

The authority and requirements of issuing Publication Numbers are indicated by Item 6 of [§4 of LCS 1](https://github.com/lcs-project/publications/blob/main/primary/LCS1.md#4-steps-of-publication). Prior to issuing a Publication Number, the Draft must have completed all preceeding review steps, unless Special Permission is obtained from the LCS Leads. 
If you have this special permission, corresponding to §3.2 of the Secretariat Rules of Order [SRC SP1](https://github.com/lcs-project/secretariat/blob/main/special-publications/SP1.md#32-publication-number-assignment-notwithstanding-4) and have a Sponsor from the LCS Leads, fill out a [Publication Number Assignment (Notwithstanding §4)](https://github.com/lcs-project/secretariat/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=03-public-number-assignment-3.2.yml).


Publication Numbers are issued for 6 months, at which point a new Publication Number is required to be issued. Extension of may be granted if deemed necessary. The issuance of an Extension is Discrentionary. 

All Publication Number Assignments, including Extensions, and Expired Assignments, are placed in <publication-assignments.csv>.
