      A Publication Number Assignment (Notwithstanding §4) is a special procedure used by the Secretariat Working Committee to cooperate with the LCS Leads in making special primary publications in non-standard ways
      This corresponds to §3.2 of [SRC SP1](https://github.com/lcs-project/secretariat/blob/main/special-publications/SP1.md#32-publication-number-assignment-notwithstanding-4).
      It is more likely that you want a normal "Publication Number Assignment".
